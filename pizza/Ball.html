            <p>The midday lull at **The Flying Tomato** is a dangerous time. The customers are full, the jukebox is playing a weird mix of opera and polka, and the Rossi brothers, Vinny and Silvio, have far too much idle energy.
It started innocently enough. Vinny was behind the counter, trying to balance seven **Perfect Pizza Balls**—the sacred, spherical dough—on his head. Silvio, wiping down a sticky table, muttered, "That's why your side of the sauce is always too watery, Vinny. No focus."
That's all it took.
"Too watery?" Vinny roared, dropping his stack. "My sauce is **bold**! Yours tastes like a damp sock filled with sadness!"
He grabbed the nearest dough ball and hurled it. It didn't just fly; it was a Vinny "The Rocket" Rossi special. It zipped past a hanging **tomato-can decoration**, setting it spinning wildly, and smacked squarely into the back of Silvio’s unsuspecting head, where it stuck like a pale, edible beanie.
Silvio froze. The kitchen went silent. Then, with a slow, terrifying turn, Silvio reached up, peeled the dough from his scalp, and squeezed it until it looked less like a ball and more like a sad, flabby pancake.
"Game on, Rocket," he whispered.</p>
<h2>The Great Ricochet of '25</h2>
<p>The fight escalated instantly. It wasn't just the brothers; the entire staff was instantly divided.</p>
