The midday lull at   The Flying Tomato   is a dangerous time. The customers are full, the jukebox is playing a weird mix of opera and polka, and the Rossi brothers, Vinny and Silvio, have far too much idle energy.

It started innocently enough. Vinny was behind the counter, trying to balance seven   Perfect Pizza Balls  —the sacred, spherical dough—on his head. Silvio, wiping down a sticky table, muttered, "That's why your side of the sauce is always too watery, Vinny. No focus."

That's all it took.

"Too watery?" Vinny roared, dropping his stack. "My sauce is   bold  ! Yours tastes like a damp sock filled with sadness!"

He grabbed the nearest dough ball and hurled it. It didn't just fly; it was a Vinny "The Rocket" Rossi special. It zipped past a hanging   tomato-can decoration  , setting it spinning wildly, and smacked squarely into the back of Silvio’s unsuspecting head, where it stuck like a pale, edible beanie.

Silvio froze. The kitchen went silent. Then, with a slow, terrifying turn, Silvio reached up, peeled the dough from his scalp, and squeezed it until it looked less like a ball and more like a sad, flabby pancake.

"Game on, Rocket," he whispered.

### The Great Ricochet of '25

The fight escalated instantly. It wasn't just the brothers; the entire staff was instantly divided.

    Team Rocket (Vinny):   Favored speed and velocity. Their strategy was to launch the dough from deep, aiming for maximum impact. Their star thrower was   Marco  , the young delivery driver, whose pitching arm was legendary.
    Team Sauce (Silvio):   Favored defense and volume. They built impromptu   Dough Ball Forts   out of pizza boxes and used the dough balls like fluffy, close-range hand grenades. Their MVP was   Aunt Gilda  , the cashier, who was terrifyingly accurate at 5 feet.

The restaurant floor transformed into a war zone of flour and fun.

  The highlights included:  

1.    The "Gondolier Gauntlet":   A customer, Mr. Henderson (a regular who wears full scuba gear to the restaurant for safety), attempted to make a break for the bathroom. He was pelted by three simultaneous throws—one off the jukebox, one off the spinning tomato can, and one directly from Aunt Gilda—before he finally reached the relative safety of the restroom stall.
2.    The Flurry of the Flour-Sack:   Marco, blinded by a handful of thrown flour, blindly launched his dough ball, which sailed over the entire dining room, through the service window, and landed directly in the center of a fresh Margherita pizza Papa Aldo was about to pull from the oven.
3.    Papa Aldo's "Ceasefire":   The fight always ends when Papa Aldo intervenes. This time, he didn't even have to yell. He simply walked into the dining room, holding the freshly ruined Margherita with the embedded dough ball, and looked at the combatants with a look of profound culinary disappointment.

"My beautiful Margherita," he sighed. "Now it is... a tragedy. And it is   cold  ."

The dough balls dropped. Vinny and Silvio immediately ran to apologize, falling over each other to clean up the flour. The customers, wiping dough residue from their hair, roared with applause. It was, as always, the most fun they'd had all week.

Order was restored. The debris was swept. And ten minutes later, Vinny was sneaking up behind Silvio with a small, perfectly rolled, still-warm pizza ball clutched in his hand.

   

 What kind of topping do you think would have been on that tragically ruined Margherita pizza?
